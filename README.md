# Phonino
a simple project to making your Arduino-Board to act as a cell-phone.
It can call or send message a number, read recieved messages like a cellphone. But the biggest feature is it's TouchScreen.

### modules which is needed:

+ Arduino Uno
+ sim800l gsm module
+ DC-DC convertor
+ 3.95" TFT LCD with Touch
+ speaker and microphone


My thanks and appreciations also go to my colleague, AA , in developing the project and people who have willingly helped us out with their abilities.
